TestSpongePlugin
================

This is my first test plugin for Sponge. Based on example plugin from here: https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI/blob/master/src/main/example/main/java/org/spongepowered/example/ExamplePlugin.java

I'm going to expand this plugin and update it as SpongeAPI will expand/change.
I'm also going to make this plugin more functional once Sponge will become usable Minecraft Server.
